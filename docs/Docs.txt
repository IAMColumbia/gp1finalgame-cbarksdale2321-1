                				-----Documentation Timeline-----
    ---POC Notes---

-Creates Grid that can load in specific blocks from a text file(Referenced a video for the text file bits)
    -Useful if time allows for the creation of seperate levels

-Adds camera movement via WASD
    - Camera doesn't exceed bounds of grid

-Can place and archer on any tile

    ---VS Notes---

Adds functional AI pathing via A* method
    -Can be tested by right clicking one tile, right clicking another tile and then pressing space
    -This will calculate the shortest possible path(including ANY obstructions) that will be used by the monster
    -You can place archers on tiles and the monster will avoid those tiles and create a new path

Adds buttons that will allow you select an archer
    -Each archer costs different amounts of currency and when you select one, RESPECT will decrease

More archer functionality
    -After selecting an archer you may place it on any tile that is highlighted green
    -If highlighted red, there is another archer on that tile and you may not place another on that tile

Monster functionality
    -Since AI pathing is complete, all that needs to be done is to hook it up to the monsters
    -Right now, you may spawn a random monster by pressing the "Next Wave" button

    ---Final Build Notes---

                -----Post-Production Log-----

Overall, this was a fun project to work on. It taught me some new things about pathfinding as well as what the Unity engine is capable of.
I ran into a few roadblocks however such as getting the A* algorithm hooked up to the monsters. I think I spent about a week on doing only
that which caused me to lose some time. This caused some features initially intended not to be in the final game. Features such as, monsters attacking archers, 
selling and upgrading system, different levels, and monsters attacking the Castle all did not make it into the game which I'm pretty bummed out about. All in all, I had a good
time learning and creating this product. Hopefully I can work on it even more and make it something bigger than initially intended.
